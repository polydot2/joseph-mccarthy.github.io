Just a quick update on the [__Hugo Bootstrap Freelancer Theme__]({{< ref "/projects/hugo-freelance" >}}). It's been accepted to the [__themes.hugo__](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemesSiteBuilder) list of themes. So you're able to see it within the library of other open source themes. You can check out the theme [__here__](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bootstrap-freelancer-template/), or all the other themes for Hugo [__here__](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/), or if you wish to just check out the [__GitHub Repository__](https://github.com/joseph-mccarthy/hugo-bootstrap-freelancer-template).
