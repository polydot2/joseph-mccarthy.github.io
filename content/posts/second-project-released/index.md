summary: It's taken a while, but I have finished my Hugo/Freelance Bootstrap Theme
---

Well this one was a pain, but so worth it as I have this nice stable site built on top of two things that I love [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio) and [Bootstrap Freelance template](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-freelancer). Now it's wasn't really that hard, it was more annoying rather than difficult. That's mostly because it's front end, which isn't really my strong side. That's a note that I should really address that and do more front end work/projects.

Another diffcult part was making this theme so that it was also useful to others rather than just myself. So I had to make sure that I had properties that would allow for text to be entered into places of the theme, where if it was just me using it, then it could have been just hard coded.

There there was the annoying fact that in order to make sure that the start bootstrap forms still worked after I made the hugo theme I had to create a trail account and run tests on a thing that I was never going to use. But again I wanted to make sure that it was useful to others besides myself, and hey some people might have wanted to use the start bootstrap forms.

But on the whole, I'm rather happy with the outcome of the theme, it looks and feels like the start bootstrap freelancer template. This means that it caters completely to my needs and my simple little slice of the internet. You can find more details about the project over on my [GitHub](https://github.com/joseph-mccarthy/hugo-bootstrap-freelancer-template)
