I'm not very good at writing, it's always been a weakness of mine. It's usually at the top of my list of things I have always wanted to improve. That's partly the reason I started this site, not only to track what I'm upto, learning and projects. But hope that a side product would be me getting better at writting in general.

Now the issue is that when I code, I tend to just focus in and forget to write things down that I come across that might be interesting for others or future me to look back on. So I have decided to create developer journals.

Now in the real world I do keep a journal, it's nothing special, but I follow the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) method. Because firstly it's super simple, keeps my brain in check, and well just works.  Now there's no way I'm going to be able to replicate that here for the development of my little applications and projects. However I can use some items from the bullet journal to help me.

Bullet journal have check lists, daily reflection and sections dedicated to projects. These are possibly things that I could bring into this little digitial notebook I have going here. So with that in mind, I have created a new section of the site called [DevLogs](/devlogs).

In devlogs you'll find a series of developer logs going forward for each project that I'm working on. These will be updated as and when I work on the project, and at times may not make much sense. But the most import thing with these is that the information has at least been captured for future me to look back on refine and turn into something more usuable.

So at the time of writing this post, I have decided to start another two projects, of which I'll focus on one at a time, but there are two ideas. These will firstly begin getting captured in the Developer Logs, as well as more formal collected information and thoughts in the projects section of the site, of which the two would be linked. Linking the developer log of a project to the project page itself in the end.
