Hi and welcome to my little slice of the inernet. Everyone has a site a place to call their own, and this is mine. It's home of my general ramberlings and thoughts. I have primarly created this little site to keep track of things that I'm working on, learning or looking to learn or do. It's probably going to be an incorherant mess to most, and probably full of grammer and spelling mistakes. But that's ok, well for me that is. It's basically my notebook, and for me to look back on an reflect in time to come. 

I'm a Software Engineer by day, and I want to continue being a Software Engineer by night, basically a busmans holiday, or strange super hero with disappointing powers! So as some of my goals this year is to actually release some software of some use into the world and learn new things. I thought I would start here.
