Hello, and welcome to my little slice of the internet. Here is the place to be. That is if you're interested in what I'm working on or trying to get working. I thought it was about time to focus on growing as a Software Engineer by trying new things. The best way is to write down what I've done so I can learn from my mistakes. As well as celebrate the little victories I achieve. The site will probably be incoherent and full of grammar and spelling mistakes. Writing is another goal of mine to improve. This site is my notebook for me to reflect on in the time to come.

So about me. I'm employed full-time as a Software-Engineer, who doesn't get to write as much code as I would like. So have to find my fix elsewhere. Therefore, I've thrown myself at some personal projects on [__GitHub__](https://github.com/joseph-mccarthy) and started this site. Day to day at work, when getting to code, the language of choice is Java. However, I've set a goal to get more comfortable with Python. Which the majority of the projects I'll attempt will be using.

I also have a young son. He has shown an interest in robots and computers, so I want to start creating some STEM projects to encourage him. These escapades will get documented here. He asks what I'm doing on the laptop or when I'm messing around with Raspberry Pis. With the amount of curiosity that he has, I have to find ways to keep that going. So it may be of interest to some. 

Another thought I've had is possibly documenting other areas of my life. Expanding the theme and not keeping this site just software and electronics. That's not the intention at the moment, but best to see what comes up. But it's a consideration that I've had. Another topic that could come up is photography. Which I'm rather [__passionate__](https://www.instagram.com/grist_frames/) about, and the genre I love is Street photography, using my camera of choice, the Richo GR3.
