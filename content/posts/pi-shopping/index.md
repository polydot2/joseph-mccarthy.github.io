summary: "Cambridge trip, always results in more Raspberry Pi's!"

I really shouldn't be allowed out on my own. Much more so when the destination is home of a store that's dedicated to everything Raspberry Pi. I went to Cambridge and for those who don't know there's an amazing store that has knowledgable staff who are all passionate about Raspberry Pi. It's like being a child in a Pi Shop? The store is called simply the [Raspberry Pi Store](https://www.raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-store/). 

I only went in to get a replacement Pi4 8Gb for use on my [Night Sky Build]({{< ref "/devlogs/night-sky-pi" >}}). But and this is the story that I'm sticking to, I was overcome with some higher power, and walked out with a lot more. I was powerless. 

Please support the store, and if you can pop in there, then please do as it's great for people who want to get into the hacking space. A store front with approachable and kowledgable staff is so helpful for a begineering or budding hobbiest, because we all know that the internet isn't very welcoming and forums can be super toxic.
