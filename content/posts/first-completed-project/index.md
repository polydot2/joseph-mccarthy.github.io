summary: I've completed my first project. This is a big deal, I never finish anything.

So anyone that knows me, would be able to tell you that I generally start a lot of different projects. Then I get bogged down, bored and then move onto something else. Leaving the initial idea and code base to die.

Well that's not the case anymore, well for this instance at least. I've finally finished a thing. Well finished in the sense that it works for me, and get's the job done. Sure it could be cleaner, and there are probably better ways to write it. But the most inmportant thing is that a project / idea was seen through till the end.

The project is a simple internet speed test monitor, that runs every 30 minutes, which checks my download, upload and ping information from my internet service provider. These are then stored in a sqlite database, to be retrieved by a rest api.

You can find more information on the project at [here.]({{< ref "/projects/internet-monitor" >}} "Internet Monitor") Or view the project on  [GitHub.](https://github.com/joseph-mccarthy/internet-monitor)
