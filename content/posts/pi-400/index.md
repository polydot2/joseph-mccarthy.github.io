I went shopping to the [Raspberry Pi Shop]({{< ref "/posts/pi-shopping" >}}). One of the items that I purchased was a Raspberry Pi 400. This little machine has always excited me, and I was looking for an excuse to get one. I managed to get money off as it was an open box example, meaning that it's been on display in the store. After some inspection of it, I was happy with the condition and thought yeah let's get it.

For those that don't know what the Raspberry Pi 400 is. It's basically a Raspberry Pi 4 built into a keyboard. Sadly it's only 4GB and doesn't have a CSI or DSI port. However other than that, it's a Raspberry Pi 4.

My initial impressions are what I expected, it's a lovely device. I can see myself using it reguarly. It has enough ports to get around most things, simple USB C power and small form factor. It's also plenty powerfull enough for day to day tasks and some coding. I'm writing this post now on it.

That being said I also have some issues with it. Firstly the keyboard size, it's rather compact. It's nice that it's a small form factor, however I'm not use to this size. This is more of a me problem than a device problem and I'm sure I'll get use to it. Secondly only 4GB, I know it's enough for most of the tasks that would be thrown at a Raspberry Pi 400, but why. There's already an 8GB Raspberry Pi 4, surely it would make sense to add a little more to the price and get the 8GB then I could see it becoming a daily driver device.
