I went shopping to the [Raspberry Pi Shop]({{< ref "/posts/pi-shopping" >}}). One of the items that I purchased was a Raspberry Pi 400. This little machine has always excited me, and I was looking for an excuse to get one. I managed to get money off as it was an open box example, meaning that it's been on display in the store. After some inspection of it, I was happy with the condition and thought yeah let's get it.

For those that don't know what the Raspberry Pi 400 is. It's basically a Raspberry Pi 4 built into a keyboard. Sadly it's only 4GB and doesn't have a CSI or DSI port. However other than that, it's a Raspberry Pi 4.
