A new version of the Freelancer Bootstrap Hugo theme has been released today. This can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/joseph-mccarthy/hugo-bootstrap-freelancer-template/releases/tag/v1.0.2). This version has a few issues address. Firstly after performing a Hugo upgrade, found that __{.URL}__ is no longer supported and was required to change this field to __{.Permalink}__. Secondly I have address some sonar concerns that were raised. Mostly to do with duplications within the CSS and hash checks on the CDN downloads.
