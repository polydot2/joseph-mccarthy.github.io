Open Source Software is amazing. People from all around the world in their own time and sometimes at their own expense create software for others to use for nothing in return. I love this, and will support it with what ever I can do. I honestly feel that this would be the hill I'll happily die on.

Now I have recently found out that you can financally support users on GitHub with one off payments or recurring monthly payments. So I have started to do this. The first people I have decided to sponser with a monthly recuring payment is [Jeff Geerling](https://github.com/geerlingguy). I feel he does so much for the Open Source community, and his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling) is both very imformative and comical.

If you're able to please support the Open Source projects that you use. If you're not able to provide financal backing to the projects or users, then at least help test their releases, provide feedback or raise issues as you come across them. They can only maker better software for you with your support. Open Source Software is about give and take, not just take.
