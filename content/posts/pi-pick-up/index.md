So the other week I made my way to Cambridge to visit the Rasberry Pi store. Hoping to get some new toys, as we all know they are impossible to buy anywhere and if you do find them, well expect to pay two or three times what the retail price should be. Well I was in luck, I managed to walk away with a Pi4 8Gb, and a Pi Zero 2W, along with a few accessories. I would have loved to purchase a few more, however for obvious reasons there is a limit per customer.

So the Pi Zero I have been wanting to get for a while. This is to be my night sky camera, as it's small and low powered. I also picked up the case for it as well as the camera module. I hope to start work on this soon, as it's been something I have been wanting to make for a while now.

The Pi 4 is to join my other Pi on the network for running various little jobs. I plan to install Open Media Vault on this and then use this with a few drives for a simple network attached storage. Alone with having OMV installed on it, I'll also spin up Portainer to manage docker images. As I plan to get some monitoring going on the network using Grafana and Promethus. Having not used any of these applications I suspect there's going to be a learning curve and look forward to it.
