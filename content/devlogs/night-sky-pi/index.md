So I now have myself a Raspberry Zero 2W. This means I can now begin a project that I have been holding off for a while, which is my night sky pi. The princple of the project is rather straight forward I want a device that I can place outside which will just look up.

During the night it will record the sky not sure if it's going to be pictures or video. Then during the day it will process those images or video to try and detect and meteors or other objects. I'm expecting a lot of planes while I tweak the code.

I'm trying to make it as lightweight as possible due to the hardware, so only time will tell if I'll be able to process the images on this device or if they will have to be offloaded to another device for processing. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/joseph-mccarthy/night-sky-pi)
